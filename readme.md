## Why the warm climate is better


Sunlight exposure increases your body’s vitamin D levels. Vitamin D can prevent cancer, provide higher energy levels, and keep your bones strong and healthy. And even though Vitamin D is so important for your health, researchers at Central Washington University claim that 77% of people are vitamin D deficient because they don’t get enough sunlight. If you’re locked up most of the year indoors because of cold temperature, ice and snow, it may be time to consider a move somewhere with more sunshine. Just remember to get a moderate amount, because getting too much sunlight can be harmful as well.
